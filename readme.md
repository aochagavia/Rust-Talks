Rust-Talks
==========

This repository contains a simple node.js application and slides that I have
used to give talks on Rust

# To view the slides

First run the following commands:

```
npm install express
node serve_files.js
```

Then go to `localhost` and go through the slides. That's all!

# Details

The slides are written in markdown and converted into html slides by
`remark.js`. This is an awesome library!
